# Tufts Language Generator
In perhaps my most controversial project yet, the Tufts Language Generator brings all the magic of Tufts University's elitist language to you at the click of a button!
This will soon be on a website once I redefine the html and css a little bit. Keep your eyes peeled, you cis-het scum!

## Requirements
* Bower
* Grunt
* SASS

## Installation
1. `npm install`
2. `bower install`
3. `grunt`

If nothing goes wrong, a heavily optimised index.html will be in the `build` folder.

## Acknowledgements
A million thank yous to the lovely people at the [Fifty Shades Generator](https://github.com/50shadesgen/50shadesgen) for a very large amount of source code. They really did all the work, allowing me to create this little tool by changing one function and redefining the vocabulary and sentences. Easy stuff! So thanks, pals!
